In this work, we aim to minimize the startup voltage of a batteryless single inductor boost converter that is targeted for thermal energy harvesting. Based on the technology scaling, the design reported in [2] is expected to result in a small startup voltage in a 130 nm technology. The targeted specifications for our design are given below:
Parameter and Value 
Startup voltage: 95mV
No. of off-chip inductor:   1
Minimum input voltage:  50mV
Output voltage: <1
Output power: <400 µW
Peak efficiency : 60%
Temperature Range : -30°C to 80°C
MPPT: 1
Dia Area:<0.17 mm2
Processor: 130nm
